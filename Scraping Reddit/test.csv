5nkbyc,"We are h3h3productions, professional complainers and YouTube drama queens. Please roast us, appreciate ya.",https://i.redd.it/78ckh6a43b9y.jpg,122,"Your videos are boring...   At best you're a pg version of iDubbz content cop at worst you're a dull Pewdiepie...  I think you're the most boring youtuber on the platform and your jokes stopped being funny last year.  Your content has gone downhill...   Subscribers are just numbers and the people who used to watch have stopped.  You think your content is special?     You think what you do impacts anyone?     No one cares...    no one laughs. ..    You mean nothing to us, to anyone.  You're just a person behind the screen.  No one cares about you as a person.  You have no friends...     You know without your channel Hila wouldn't have given you a second look.   Youtube hates you...  ...We all hate you...  That's why when Leafy  complained you had betrayed him we were all quick to turn on you.  We don't like you. .. You're just a way to fill the day.    You're jokes are overused and even Hugh Mungus hasn't been given enough by you to make up for the fact he had to be on your videos.    ...No one wants to be on your videos...    That's why you have to beg more popular youtubers to give you the time of day because in the end the truth is that all you ever did was take popular topics and make them less edgy.       ...Do you think what you do matters?  ... Do you think anyone cares?   Do you think when you make your coughing noise you're being original?  If you continued coughing and died the world would move on.   No one cares,  and you know this.   You know your content is just something people put on in the back ground when they don't want to have to pay attention anymore.  If you were gone the world would move on as if you'd never been.   You think the world cares about a fat fuck "goofing" on videos?   That's why you make self depreciating jokes and try to mock yourself because the truth is if you're not a clown and a thing we all strive not to be no one would care about what you do.    You make yourself the butt of the joke because you know that if you didn't, you'd just be the joke.    ...That's why you try so hard to be loved.    ... That's why you try so hard to be accepted.    If anyone says they love you they're lying.   You should stop making videos.   You should stop making heart beats. Everyone would be happier if you just deleted your channel.  Edit: Jesus people it's a roast, it's supposed to be a bit mean.  I intentionally made it tryhard and edgy because that's the kind of stuff they like to laugh at.   I was a big enough fan that when h3h3 posted on twitter asking for roasts I finally broke down  and made a reddit account just to join in.      Take away: Don't take roasts seriously, goddamn!"
